Project designed to create and browse Research Objects following the W3C LDP protocol and using LDP4J (http://www.ldp4j.org/#/).
The project consists on a client for easily creating ROs and a connector to handle the requests to LDP.
This is a work in progress.

The specification for the alignment between the RO model and LDP can be accessed on the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqn0nW7u0Lo0KubexFwBpQbyhnX4Tf2SXs3n5KMrg4/edit#

Currently supported: Creation of simple ROs, RO description and RO browisng. 

Currently working on: Adding folders, handling of Zip files, improvements to the client html (see issues).
